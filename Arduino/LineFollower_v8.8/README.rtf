\f0\fs24 \cf0 The associated code was done as my senior design project along with two other team members. I was the person writing the software so the code was written by myself. This code was developed using the Arduino IDE for an Arduino. \
\
The senior design project was for a robot to autonomously traverse a 10\'92 by 10\'92 board to pick up and placed 25 colored tokens into certain spots on the board as fast as possible. This was tested at an IEEE robotics competition. The tokens were flush with the board, and the board had black lines to help with traversal. The software controls the motors used to propel the robot through the coarse. The software also read an IR sensor array that was used to determine where black lines were on the board. A PID algorithm was used to follow the black lines. There was a carousel powered by a different motor that held the tokens. An electromagnet attached to a rack and pinion was used to pick up, place, and drop off tokens onto the carousel.}
